    """
    Function that generates circuit that prepares spin-(N_site/2) VBS
    state via probabilistic method based on Hadamard test introduced in
    Sec. VI of B. Murta, P. M. Q. Cruz and J. FernÃ¡ndez-Rossier, Phys.
    Rev. Research 5, 013190 (2023). 
    qubit_pairs is a list of two-element lists, each containing the 
    indices of the qubit pairs forming a valence bond in the pre-VBS 
    state. qubit_pairs therefore defines the connectivity of the 
    underlying lattice. sets_of_qubits_encoding_a_site is a list of
    N_site-element lists, each corresponding to the indices of the
    qubits that define a local spin-(N_site/2) local degree of
    freedom at a lattice site.
    If with_rep_mitigation == False, every lattice site is associated
    with an ancillary qubit, which must be measured in the |1) state
    to ensure the successful symmetrization of the respective site.
    Such computational basis measurements of the ancillas are not
    included in the circuit. The ancillary qubits are the most
    significant ones and their order follows that of the respective
    sites in the sets_of_qubits_encoding_a_site input.
    If with_rep_mitigation == True, num_islands_rep_mitigation is
    called to determine which sites are symmetrized deterministically
    first (via the qc_island_bulk circuit provided as an input or, in its
    absence, generic state preparation using the SVD-based method
    by Plesch and Brukner), with the remaining sites being symmetrized
    probabilistically via the Hadamard test.
    The (N_site+1)-qubit circuit that implements the local Hadamard test
    can be provided via the qc_Hadamard input. If it is not provided, 
    then its circuit is generated via the quantum Shannon decomposition
    of the controlled-exp(-i pi Symmetrization).

    """
    Function that generates quantum circuit to prepare spin-1 VBS
    state, the ground state of the 1D AKLT model. Specifically, the
    standard n-depth sequential method discussed in Sec. III.A of
    K. C. Smith, E. Crane, N. Wiebe and S. M. Girvin, PRX Quantum
    4, 020315 (2023) [see, in particular, Fig. 1(b) and Eq. 6] is
    implemented, where n is the number of sites (i.e., spins-1).
    
    For BC == 'OBC' (open boundary conditions), this method is 
    identical to the generic MPS method implemented in function 
    MPS_preparation_quantum_circuit_OBC, except that boundary 
    conditions are imposed explicitly on quantum hardware, namely
    through the addition of an ancillary qubit. The RHS boundary 
    condition is provided via the input RHS_BC, which can be 
    either 0 (spin-up) or 1 (spin-down). The RHS BC is imposed 
    right at the start of the circuit, but the LHS BC results 
    from the measurement of the ancilla at the end in the 
    computational basis, yielding either outcome (spin-up or 
    spin-down) with 50% of probability. This measurement is not
    included explicitly in the quantum circuit, as further 
    coherent manipulations may be considered.
    
    For BC == 'PBC' (periodic boundary conditions):
        
        If with_SWAP_test == False, 2 ancillas are used, which 
        correspond to the two most significant qubits at the end 
        of the circuit. Projecting these two qubits onto the spin 
        singlet 1/sqrt(2) [|01) - |10)] ensures the VBS state with 
        PBCs is successfully prepared in the remaining 2n qubits. 
        Transformation from computational basis to Bell basis is 
        already included in circuit, so the only part that is left
        as post-processing is the actual measurement in computational
        basis, just in case further coherent manipulation of the main
        2n-qubit register is required. Measuring ancillas in |00)
        occurs with 25% probability and ensures successful preparation.
    
        If with_SWAP_test == True, 3 ancillas are used, again the
        most significant qubits (2n, 2n+1, 2n+2). In these qubits
        the SWAP test is implemented at the end of the circuit, in
        line with the discussion in Appendix A of the reference.
        Measuring the most significant qubit 2n+2 in |1) ensures
        successful preparation of n-site VBS state with PBCs
        on the main 2n-qubit register, with the other two ancillas
        (2n, 2n+1) separated from those 2n qubits and encoding a 
        spin singlet. As in the option with_SWAP_test == False, 
        this happens with 25% of probability. 
        If instead the most significant qubit is measured in |0), 
        symmetrization is unsuccessful, but the resulting defect can

        (2n, 2n+1), in which case we obtain a (n+1)-site VBS state 
        [notice the extra site] with PBCs on 2n+2 qubits. That is,
        the ancillas (2n, 2n+1) become part of the main register 
        and encode a site of the VBS state. Hence, unlike the

def VBS_spin_1_preparation_Yale_sequential_middle(n, BC, with_SWAP_test=False):
    """
    Function that generates quantum circuit to prepare spin-1 VBS
    state, the ground state of the 1D AKLT model. Specifically, the
    standard (n/2)-depth sequential method [starting in the middle
    of the chain or ring] discussed in Sec. III.B of K. C. Smith, 
    E. Crane, N. Wiebe and S. M. Girvin, PRX Quantum 4, 020315 
    (2023) [see, in particular, Fig. 2 and Eq. 8] is implemented, 
    where n is the number of sites (i.e., spins-1).
    
    For BC == 'OBC' (open boundary conditions), the qubits that set
    the boundaries at the least and most significant ones (0, 2n+1).
    Both have to be measured in the computational basis to impose
    the boundary conditions. All four combinations of BCs (up-up,
    up-down, down-up, down-down) have identical probability of
    occurrence, ignoring finite-size effects. The resulting VBS
    state with OBCs is therefore prepared in the remaining 2n qubits,
    corresponding to a n-site chain.
    
    For BC == 'PBC' (periodic boundary conditions):
        
        If with_SWAP_test == False, 2 ancillas are used. They 
        correspond to qubits 0 and 2n+1 at the end of the circuit,
        just like for OBCs. Projecting these two qubits onto the spin 
        singlet 1/sqrt(2) [|01) - |10)] ensures the VBS state with 
        PBCs is successfully prepared in the remaining 2n qubits. 
        Transformation from computational basis to Bell basis is 
        already included in circuit, so the only part that is left
        as post-processing is the actual measurement in computational
        basis, just in case further coherent manipulation of the main
        2n-qubit register is required. Measuring ancillas in |00)
        occurs with 25% probability and ensures successful preparation.
    
        If with_SWAP_test == True, 3 ancillas are used, at positions
        (0, 2n+1, 2n+2) at the end of the circuit. In these qubits
        the SWAP test is implemented, in line with the discussion 
        in Appendix A of the reference. Measuring the most significant 
        qubit 2n+2 in |1) ensures successful preparation of n-site 
        VBS state with PBCs on the main 2n-qubit register (qubits 1,2,
        ..., 2n-1, 2n), with the other two ancillas (0, 2n+1) separated 
        from those 2n qubits and encoding a spin singlet. As in the 
        option with_SWAP_test == False, the probability is of 25%. 
        If instead the most significant qubit is measured in |0), 
        symmetrization is unsuccessful, but the resulting defect can 
        be corrected by applying a Y gate at the other two ancillas 
        (0, 2n+1), in which case we obtain a (n+1)-site VBS state 
        [notice the extra site] with PBCs on 2n+2 qubits. That is,
        the ancillas (0, 2n+1) become part of the main register 
        and encode a site of the VBS state. In this case, to make
        sure that all pairs of qubits a site are next to each other
        in a linear architecture, a permutation of the qubits is
        implemented to move qubit 0 past the 2n qubits in the
        original main register to be next to qubit 2n+1.

    The key difference between this method and the previous ones is that
    one considers the preparation of dimers in parallel and then fuses
    them through measurements of ancillas in the Bell basis. If the singlet
    is obtained, then the fusion is successful, otherwise defects are added.
    The correction of these defect via post-processing does not commute with
    the operations associated with the imposition of the overall boundary
    conditions (i.e., Bell basis measurement or SWAP test for PBCs, and 
    computational basis measurements for OBCs). As a result, unlike in
    the implementations of the previous methods, the subcircuits associated
    with the SWAP test or the basis changes in the outermost ancillas are
    not included in the circuit that is returned by this function. They
    must therefore be applied explicitly in the post-processing part after
    having corrected the defects.
