## Description
 Methods to simulate quantum many-body systems on gate-based quantum computers:

 1. Generic state preparation methods.

    a. Arbitrary states via Shende-Bullock-Markov and Plesch-Brukner methods.

    b. Matrix product states with open (deterministic) and periodic (probabilistic) boundary conditions.
 
 2. Bespoke state preparation methods.

    a. Quantum information (e.g., GHZ states, W states).

    b. Quantum spin models (e.g., AKLT states, spin waves, RVB approximations of ground states of spin-1/2 Heisenberg model).

    c. Lattice models of electrons (e.g., Slater determinants, Gutzwiller wave function).
    
 3. Unitary decompositions, including qubit connectivity constraints.

    a. Permutations of qubits.

    b. Conversion of multi-spin-1/2 states into fermionic versions at half-filling.  

    c. CNOT, Toffoli, and Fredkin under linear qubit connectivity with separated active qubits.

## Organization
For the sake of clarity, the *notebooks* folder includes Jupyter notebooks that include examples of the usage of the methods. The respective code scripts are in the *scripts* folder.
